Overridable templates
---------------------
django-blog-pkg ships many templates, viewable in the blog/templates directory.

For instance, the view corresponding to the post_list URL uses the template blog/post_list.html. If you create a file with this name in your code layout, it can override the one shipped with django-blog-pkg.
